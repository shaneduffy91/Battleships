# Project 3 - Mega Battleships

For my third project with Code Institute, I have created a Battleships game.

## Rules of the Game
Mega Battleships is based on the classic pen and paper game. For more information 
see Wikipedia.

In this version of the game, the player enters their name and two boards are
randomly generated.

The player's ships are marked with the letter S and can be seen by the player. However 
the player cannot see the location of the computer's ships.

The player and computer take it in turns to guess the coordinates of the ships location.

Incorrect guesses are marked with an X, while # is used to indicate a hit.

Whoever sinks all their opponents ships first, wins the game.
