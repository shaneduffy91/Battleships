# Project 3 - Mega Battleships

For my third project with Code Institute, I have created a Battleships game.

## Rules of the Game
Mega Battleships is based on the classic pen and paper game. For more information 
see Wikipedia.

In this version of the game, the player enters their name and two boards are
randomly generated.
